Punish game is you reacting to what you look at the opponent doing
Look and follow them with your eyes and react to it with optimal punish



# Fox
*CRUCIAL*
## FD Chain grab 0-Death
z only till 19%
pivot to right after 19%
from 47%, do u-air
u-air F-smash at 60% (need to do 1 u-air regrab before this or mix up with u-tilt f-smash)
70-80%:
soft uair -> f-smash
or
tipper u-air -> up b
80-90%: (turn around if needed) FF -> tipper u-air -> up b
90-100%: FH up b

## U-Throw Platform tech chase
Short-Hop Fast-Fall Upairs, Uptilt, and Fsmash. You can also Waveland down onto the platform and grab him, especially if you expect him to spotdodge or shield
 
0-21%: U-Tilt
21%-60%: FF U-Air
60-70%: F-Smash (Mabey U-Air -> F-Smash on no DI as its very hard to f-smash) \*Also don't work on DL, just do bellow one
70%-80%: FH U-Air / FF U-Air
80%+: U-Air -> D-Air / D-Air *OR* Up-B
 
 Can mix up at any point with F-Smash or WL Grab

## Fox RTC
Look at the feet, the sound queue is when you look at them, then dash grab in the direction he goes

5-17%: Tfair -> grab 
23%+: (DI in) Tfair -> JC grab
0-11%: AC n-air -> instant grab
11%+: (DI in) AC n-air -> JC grab
7-19%: dair -> grab
0-???: sour fair -> instant grab
# Marth

## Juggles

*CRUCIAL*
## Act out of CC d-Tilt
JC grab if close, else dash grab

## Counter hit fair

## U-Throw / F-Throw mix-up follow ups

# Falco
*CRUCIAL*
## FD Chain grab 0-Death
0-15% Just Z
15-30% Just Z on slight / no DI, dash JC grab on full DI
30-40% pivot regrab or dash JC grab
40-50% u-tilt -> regrab
50-60%: F-smash on DI out, u-tilt -> u-air -> Up-B / F-smash on all other DI
60-70%: f-smash on all DIs
70-90%: (delayed if needed) U-air -> f-smash
90-120: Up-B

Around 40% u-tilt is good
At 55% do u-air
At 60% can just do f-smash
70%+: Look at Fox

## U-Throw Platform tech chase
Same as Fox

## Low % Tech chases

*CRUCIAL*
## Take lazer (SDI up) fair
Getting timing down, dont SDI atm, but can F-air from 1-5 frames oostun

*CRUCIAL*
## PS lazer into WD
Can easily WD oos after PS from crouch, slightly harder from DD as I let go of R too quickly

*CRUCIAL*
## Escape Shield pressure with WD OoS


## Slide of from D-Air on plat

0-18%: Tfair -> grab 

# Puff
*CRUCIAL*
## Pivot Throw follow-ups
I am happy with my consistence on pivot Fsmash
Started practising d-throw pivots not just f-throw

Note: cannot C-Stick and Grey stick at the same time, even on the same frame.
It has to be, stick back one frame, the next frame c-stick > 80%

## Combo Throw follow-ups
Note: you are actionable SUPER early compared to other characters, meaning you can basicly do the throw and just go for the follow up immediately

## CC grab bad aerials at low %s
Was doing hora

## Edge guarding set-ups


# Sheik
*CRUCIAL*
## U-Throw Combos
At low %s (20-30), you get a true U-Tilt -> 1 or 2 (Fair / U-Airs) -> edge guard / very high Juggle

At mid %s (30-50), it seams I can only true combo 1 uair or 1 fair -> U-Air for a high % juggle, and not really anything else unless the sheik DIs directly left or right, allowing the fair strings to work again

At higher %s (50+) you get true strings into edge guards / juggles off the top of the screen

On platform stages can get more U-Air ladder combos

I prefer the plats more, allows for more options in punish game

*CRUCIAL*
## Grab ledge when facing it


## Low % Tech chases
F-Throw may not tech chase at low %, so can get re grab

D-Throw setups for a tech chase

Look for tech in place

## High % Tech chases
After U-Throw no longer works, can react to tech in place and roll, and can re-grab hard DI in (or F-smash if I feel like being super fast), just need to make sure to get over there in time lol

72 - 99 %
when going for WD -> D-Smash, can react to tech in place  or roll in for tipper, can do nothing on roll away + keeps space

100%+
Walk forwards and F-Smash on reaction to holding in, tech in place, miss tech
F-Smash behind on roll in
Dash -> F-Smash on roll out

## F-Air / N-Air combos
F-Air -> grab alot low % (<50%)
F-Air -> Dash attack -> F-Smash at low mid % (30-50)
F-Air ->  F-Smash at mid % (40-70)

# Falcon
*CRUCIAL*
## Low->Mid % Tech chase
RAW react to each, position self for tech in place, as you just have to grab on reaction, rolls you can dash JC grab, and miss tech hold down

Please LOOK at the Falcon, you cannot react otherwise

Can react to tech in place with the flip

*CRUCIAL*
## U-Throw follow ups

35-50%:
U-Tilt -> F-Smash / F-Air @ all DIs apart from full in / out 
F-Smash @ full in / out 

50-55%:
Wait

Weak U-Tilt -> F-Smash @ slight DI
F-Smash @ full DI

55-60%:
U-Tilt -> F-Smash @ slight DI in-front of you
F-Smash @ all other DIs

60-67%
F-Smash

67-100%
Tipper Fair is best for combos
Tho Tipper U-Air is good for when he is directly above you to combo into Tipper F-Air or N-Air

100-120%:
No DI: DJ N-Air
Full DI: DJ Tipper F-Air / N-Air

need to work on timing the f-smash better, u-tilt timing is very quick at frame 1-3
