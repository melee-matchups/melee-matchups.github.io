# Stuff

stop f-smashing

You need to hold your ground more (stop getting pushed to corner)
- Aerial in place/fadeback aerial are great for this
- In-place Dtilt too

Play closer
- Poke more

Do more call-out mix ups

dont be too afraid to push advantage

Don't f-smash at high %s too much vs sheik

# Things I can pratice
ledge grab fast-fall

Fox punish game
Sheik punish game
Punish game!

# Solo pratice:
- pill / missile save states / labbing
- sour spot fair Combos at mid -> high %s
- wd oos
- Combo game / Edge gaurding

# In game / friendlies:
- play more samus / doc
- fair anti airs
- working on scrambles
- rely on advantage and not raw fsmash

# Things I notice
Ledge grabbing

Sheild drop

WD OOS

Please pratice run off fair

See where I can go offstage

SDI u-throw u-air

Flip between neutral and punish better

Side B to stall when in juggles to throw off timings

N-air in-place / stop doing slight dash n-air


# The big
- Doing more Mix up situations (move from lv 4 of llods guide to lv 5)
- Call out you more (find habits and call them out, do the 80% of melee that is pattern matching)
- Work on my dog shit recovery lmao
- I am a Marth main and I can not juggle for my life
- Empty landing + mind games

# Luke
Intention to move:
To beat something they do
/ 
beat something they might do to beat you doing that thing



Dash dancing better -> force option



Speed / hit Hit-boxes that are good (pick hit boxes)
Dash away and f-smash / grab landings

# May
Juggle better, think "how do I stop to land"
Also, I get what people (KoDoRin) means by saying getting out of a juggle is like trying  to play 2 mix ups when juggling is only one
As as the jugglie, you need to first win the "is he going to do it or not" mix up, then after win the "what he does" mix up, where the juggler just needs to win the mix-up on what you do, as you can't choose to not play the mix up 


Follow them before stopping them from landing

sheild "button"
work more on recovery / side b usage
Empty land more
use dtilt to force jumps not to hit

- overshooting more
DDing - mix it up / do call out mix ups



Recover low some more
Don't always run at me, bait with DD more, and grab


Do you mind me asking questions in between sets?
