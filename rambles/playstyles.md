# Keep-out

## Goals: 
Keep opponent out from coming into you

## Playstyle
Keep them out at all cost, use disjoint to wall them out and mix up your options so you don't get punished

# Pressure

## Goals: 
Make opponent feel like they need to act and punish them for doing so,

## Playstyle
Stay close enough to punish, but keep them out from getting too close
Punish them when they miss you

# In-Face

## Goals: 
Get close enough to hit them but keep them out from getting any closer

## Playstyle
Move towards them, get to a point where you sword can out range their up close buttons
Use disjoined swords to stop them from moving closer, but also to poke at them.

# Center

## Goals: 
Get to center, playing MU game-plan from center is better

## Playstyle
If not in center, focus on getting there
Otherwise play MU game plan in center

## Notes
center is your friend, especially in these MUs

You can basically deny them any hope of playing neutral by controlling the center of the stage and swat them or whiff punish them
