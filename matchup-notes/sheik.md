# Stuff to add

## Neutral

### D-Tilt
Put Sheik Jump mode or CC mode
CC is more threatening

D-Tilt is still good at high %s

Don't worry about mashing D-Tilt at the correct / tipper range (as if they try to CC / get you, it hits again), but don't mash it at close range.




Watch out for grab

DD -> safe from grab
Have to outplay by overshoot grab



Avoid scrap
Avoid platform fighting

at CC%s vs sheik, use MAX ranged moves






CC-ing mix up with D-Tilt when you think sheik will come in
- Only worried about needle and run up grab
- Plant seed / condition them to "grab time", then go back to dash dancing


If sheik in jump mode:
- Go air to air
- Better aerial drift, fade back or in-place
- Don't do this in corner -> get back to center





## Edge guarding
Put on pressure - Go offstage
D-Smash is optimal punish for when they go on stage
Sheik is a sitting duck
Fair off stage (at like 40%)

Grab ledge for early up b



If sheik does attacks from ledge, you can amsah tech (without the sheild) to slide off to ledge

edge cancel bair -> grab ledge

## Throws

F-Throw / D-Throw tech chase to 22%


## Sharking 101
Directly above -> Uair / Utilt(No Jump)
Side -> Fair / bair
Platforms -> mini-FD
Do have jump -> areials
No jump -> utilt

If they throw a move out horizontally when landing, whiff punish it with grab / dash attack
Bait out spot-dodge if they land with nothing / air dodge

Directly under -> watch sheik

Landing fair is really good because you can jump and decide if you should fair or empty land
If your in a position where instant fair is good, you shouldn't be in that position to begin with





When U-Air-ing sheik, can land on platforms for less lag

To platform to do a fair?

DD Shield stop fairs

Default to DD + F-Airs

Full drift N-Air to call out empty jumps -> full combo





















----------------------------------

Keepout
- D-Tilt for ground
- F-Air / Fade back F-Air for Aerials
Whiff punish
- Dash back grab to beat grabs
- Can also do it for some aerials and grounded moves if spaced perfectly
Callout
- N-Air call out Jump
- Grab call out CC
- Dash Attack to call out other shit (risky)
- CC for a ground attack

Mix up with platforms (DJ WD) fair
Hold Down after N-Air and F-Air

CC up B when sheik at high %s


F-Air and N-Air full combo (can get another or a grab / dash attack)

Can just hold ledge as edge guard as forces them to go high

Up B tech chase

Up B vs needles on sheild

ladrer from utilt into F-Smash

Bridges on FD to D-Air


Upthrow uptilt
Port 1
- no DI     (22%-37%)
- down away (18%-38%*)
- away      (18%-30%*)
- slight in (27%-40%*)
-> down + slight in works against upthrow and fthrow below 27%
- full in   (22%-30%)
Port 4
- no DI     (18%-39%*)
- down away (13%-37%*)
- away      (13%-25%*)
- slight In (22%-40%*)
-> down + slight in works against upthrow and fthrow below 22%
- full In   (13%-31%**)

*you can true combo uptilt after this, but need to delay the uptilt for a specific amount of frames
** turn around uptilt will hit a double jump between 13%-17% 


# Neutral

## Movement
You have 3 modes in this MU, walling mode, short hop mode, and dash mode.
Walling in this MU = Mash D-Tilt / SH FF Landing in-place F-Air
Dash mode is to avoid grab.

Sheik does have a excellent Dash speed, but not initial dash, so she can chase someone, but once she is chasing someone, she can't really dash away.

Dash mode is used to bait grab to punish it

Walling with D-Tilt cuts off Sheiks ground options (apart from CC grab) and can CC aerials at low %

Short hopping allows you to F-Air, witch cuts off aerial approaches and can cover her trying to come in without CC.

With F-Air, you want to be Tipper-ing it if she is on the ground and not in an action, otherwise its better to empty hop.

## Gameplan
You want to figure out if the sheik wants to:
- Jump & Aerial
- Grab you
- Approach from the ground

Walling beats Ground Approach but loses to grab, depends on % for aerials
Dashing beats Grab, but looses to ground approach, aerials dont hit you, but you can't punish them ether

## Options to respect

### Grab
Can D-Tilt or F-Air it before it gets out, but is better to dash dance vs Sheik wanting grab, as she has to overextend to get you, at witch point you can D-Tilt, F-Air or grab her.

### AC F-Air


### Needles


### Ground Moves


## Options not to respect
### Dair
Can Amsha tech it
Negative hitbox.

## Combos


## Edge Guarding
Hit sheik up b with fair, dont try to hit them, try hitting the up b lol

Remember when they have jump

if no jump, see if they are too far and will die to hog
Go out to hit otherwise
