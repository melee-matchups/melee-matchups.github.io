# Stuff to add

spam crouch and dash-back and wall with aerials,
only drift forward if you have a read

and only fsmash if it's from a tipper at a considerable %

prioritize grab into fthrow and dthrow
you get regrab or tech chase
and at 40%ish you can start fishing for fthrow/dthrow pivot tipper
on di away you get tech chase normally

also think about the things that combo into grab and help you get more grabs, like tipper dair grab or dtilt into dash forward grab or 1st hit nair grab

and when you edgeguard think about it like Sheik
grab ledge and refresh and wait for upb
then neutral getup and punish
trust me bro

a well timed ledgehop dair or bair can cover pika going stage/ledge too

or you can learn to dtilt on reaction at the edge, kinda like you did with dsmash



1 i go ledge (your getup kills me)
2 i go stage (you punish after getup)
3 i go platform or higher (you are safe but get no punish)
to cover option 3 you have to read it and instead of getup from ledge you do a ledgedash
and youre ready to cover platform
JUST LIKE VS SHEIK!!
