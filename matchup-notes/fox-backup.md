The way to beat Fox is to out manoeuvre him
You must keep pace with his obligatory bullshit, space around it and punish hard when given an opening
ALLWAYS be looking at the Fox, you will not be able to react to his shit otherwise

You must be comfortable with moving around with DD and WD, combining the 2 to make a perfectly spaced neutral

After this has been achieve, you will be moving around the Fox's burst options, those most commonly being a dash or sh into a very fast move
You will need to react to witch he choses and punish accordingly
Additinaly, you will need to observe if the Fox wishes to over extend
The best way to stop this is to wall just outside of his dash distance, using fast fall fair and nair and dtilt to make sure he doesn't try to attack your dash backs, and to catch any unthoughtful approaches (tho these are more to threaten rather than try to hit him)

Finaly if the Fox decides that approaching is not game, then just run up dtilt / fair then GTFO of there, this should make them do shit most the time

You really do not want to approach Fox most the time, by approach, I mean be anywhere near him, since that's where he will be at his strongest, so the best position for you, is cornering him, so take space, but NEVER overextend on him, you can overshoot if he does not want to play for a prolonged period of time, otherwise keep your zone

"respect": "Mix up DI on uthrow and uair, try making him dash the furthest distance, then make him dash no where\n\nRespect his ledge-dash, that shit is insane, when near the ledge, stand just far enough where fair will hit a max distance ledge dash usmash, this will allow you to react to what he does after it, and you can punish if he tries something stupid\n\nFOR THE EVER LOVING FUCK PLEASE STOP JUMPING INFRONT OF FOX, he will kill you for it, never ever jump when you are in his DD range, it is not worth it, you can jump outside of it to wall, but never to an aerial inside of his range",

"combos": "Basically try to dair him or fsmash him after aerials, utilt is a good combo starter, often leading him offstage or into a dair\n\nSuper late fair/spaced nair can both lead to a clean grab opportunity at low %",
