## Movement
Like Puff, you do not want to scrap with Falco at close range.
His D-Air lasts forever and covers the entire area around him.
Along with his shine, being close to him almost always means you'll end up being combo-ed.

So VS Falco, you will want to play a walling game.

You want to stay far enough away where you wont get hit by F-Smash, but close enough where you can still hit his jump forwards with a N-Air in place.
Once you have gotten into this position, you will play footies with the Falco with his burst options and lazers.

You don't want to give the Falco an approach, as Marth, you want the Falco to come to you and chase you down. If you both go for each-other, Falco's moves just win due to their size and longer lasting hitbox.

## Gameplan
Falco is all about keeping up pressure, so Marth's job is to alleviated as much of this pressure as he can.

Falco's primary tools are all aerials (excluding a few), meaning he has to jump to get anything done, we can exploit this in a variety of ways.

You will need to watch where the Falco likes to jump and how he does it.

## Falco Shield Pressure And Playing From The Corner
When in the corner, you want to find you way back to center, however, if the Falco is playing hot, this is a hard task.
If you find yourself cornered, the first thing to do is not to panic.
I used to always try to grab him or jump out, this is very VERY bad.

```@TODO talk about SH aerial in place vs goto center VS light sheild```

The best option I have found is to light shield in the corner. This forces Falco to ether shield pressure you, witch since your in the corner, will put you back to ledge, resetting the situation, or grabbing you, witch he shouldn't get anything off of, maybe an edge guard situation if he F-Throws, but DI will let you get back fairly consistently.

After he starts going for grab or ways to beat the shield, you can start mixing up by rolling in, dashing, or jumping to a platform or over him to get to center.
