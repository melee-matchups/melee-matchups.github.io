# Neutral

## Movement
Want to hold canter and take space when possible, don't want to be far away
DD so that you can threaten going in to overshoot grab or f-smash

Otherwise swat missiles with fair or jab
Jab beats missiles without approaching, but if she approaches with an missile, f-air is better as it hits her too.
FH can be used if there is too much shit on the screen

n-air and d-tilt are good for when Samus want to approach / force her way towards you
d-tilt is used when she WD and you don't jave enough time to AC n-air

Getting out of corner is hard, so want to be pushing them back

## Gameplan

DD in center threatening an approach with grab, f-air or f-smash

Keep her out from getting in with walling with N-airs and d-tilts.

Then force her in the air with grab and f-airs.

## Options to respect

### Missiles
Random missles can be jabbed if Samus is far enough away

## CC
D-air beats CC and is a call out for it, but otherwise space for tipper.

## Options not to respect


# Punish Game

## Punish routes


## Combos


## Edge Guarding

Go all the way to ledge and use d-tilt and f-smash to cover just in-front of ledge, then punish Samus playing around that range

If they go high, swat them back

If they go low, ledge hog into b-air / d-air or go off and up B them
